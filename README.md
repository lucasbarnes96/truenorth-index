# True Inflation Canada

Real-time Canadian inflation nowcast with strict publish gates and transparent source health.

## What changed
- API-first architecture (`FastAPI + Pydantic`).
- Strict release gate (runs can fail and stay unpublished).
- APIFY is required for food and must be recent (<=14 days).
- Weekly APIFY cadence for free-tier cost control.
- Source health includes explicit age text (`updated X days ago`).

## Runtime and dependencies
- Python `3.11` is required (`.python-version`).
- Install pinned dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Optional fully pinned install:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.lock
```

## Environment
Create `.env`:

```bash
APIFY_TOKEN=your_token
# Optional overrides
# APIFY_ACTOR_IDS=sunny_eternity/loblaws-grocery-scraper,ko_red/loblaws-grocery-scraper
# APIFY_CATEGORY_URL=https://www.realcanadiansuperstore.ca/food/dairy-eggs/c/28003
# APIFY_MAX_ITEMS=50
```

## Run ingestion

```bash
python3 process.py
```

Output artifacts:
- `data/latest.json` (latest run, includes failed gates)
- `data/published_latest.json` (last gate-passing run)
- `data/historical.json` (published history)
- `data/runs/*.json` (versioned run snapshots)
- `data/releases.db` (run metadata table)

Exit code:
- `0` when published
- `1` when gate fails

## Run API

```bash
uvicorn api.main:app --reload
```

Endpoints:
- `GET /v1/nowcast/latest`
- `GET /v1/nowcast/history?start=YYYY-MM-DD&end=YYYY-MM-DD`
- `GET /v1/sources/health`
- `GET /v1/releases/latest`
- `GET /v1/methodology`

## Dashboard
Serve static UI and point it to API:

```bash
python3 -m http.server
```

Open `http://localhost:8000`. The dashboard fetches from `/v1/...` and expects the API on the same origin/reverse proxy.

## Release gate policy
A run is blocked (`failed_gate`) if any condition fails:
1. APIFY missing or older than 14 days.
2. Required sources missing (`statcan_cpi_csv`, `statcan_gas_csv`, and at least one energy source).
3. Snapshot schema validation fails.
4. Category point minimums fail.
5. Official CPI metadata missing (`latest_release_month`).

## CI
GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/scrape.yml`):
- Uses Python 3.11.
- Runs ingestion + tests.
- Enforces gate with `scripts/check_release_gate.py`.
- Commits generated data only on published runs.

## Notes
This remains an experimental nowcast and is not an official CPI release.
