"""Housing listings scraper — Rentals.ca National Rent Report.

Parses the monthly "National Rent Report" from Rentals.ca to get the latest
"average asking rent" for all property types in Canada. This is a leading indicator
compared to the official StatCan CPI (which tracks paid rents, including rent-controlled units).
